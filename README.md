# open-letter
Hello Good People at College Board,

Thanks for giving my code a look. The main code is in open-letter.html, college.css and index.js

I write my code in Sublime Text set up with a MAMP server so that I can quickly refresh and go through fast iterations. This page from conception to completion took perhaps 6 hours, but I don't think speed should be as much of a factor as clean, semantic, accessible code. Please look through the HTML and CSS and see what I was able to do without a lot of javascript as I always strive to limit it's use to when it's necessary.
